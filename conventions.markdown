Coding Conventions
==================

Quick review of the conventions used writing this libraries

- No camel case except in the type names (classes, enums, typedefs) or library names. 
- Use underscore instead to separate the words in the names.
- Prefer verbose but clear names to concise but obscure or ambiguous names.
- Class private variables start with an underscore.
- 2 spaces indent.
- Use the format *WARNING: some explanation*  to advise of known problematic spots or possibly unexpected behaviour.
- Use the word *FIXME* to mark a problematic point that will be fixed, hopefully in the near future. :)

I could elaborate on why to use precisely this conventions... but maybe later. :)
