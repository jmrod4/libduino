LIBDUINO
========

These are a set of libraries written in the Arduino C++ variant and are 
intended to run in the Arduino IDE. 

Is there a need of yet another library for Arduino? Well, maybe not, but 
everything I have browsed seems to be to complicated, too big, or even using 
features that aren't implemented in the Arduino C++ libraries (at least not
yet) so I set on a:

> developer friendly, elegant and highly efficient executing in the Arduino.

Additionaly I like developing such kind of minimalist and extremely clear basic
libraries so no problem at all (I hope).

Peace.
